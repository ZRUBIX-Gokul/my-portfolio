IMPORTANT: TO ENABLE REAL EMAIL SENDING

1. Create a new file named ".env.local" in this folder (e:\Gokul Zrubix\my-portfolio\).
2. Copy and paste the following content into it:

EMAIL_USER=gokulsenthil43@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=YOUR_GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD

---------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO GET YOUR GMAIL APP PASSWORD:
1. Go to your Google Account Settings -> Security.
2. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled.
3. Search for "App Passwords" in the search bar at the top/
4. Create a new App Password (App: Mail, Device: Other).
5. Copy the 16-character code it gives you.
6. Paste that code in place of YOUR_GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD above.
7. Save the file and Restart the server (Ctrl+C, then npm run dev).
---------------------------------------------------------

UNTIL YOU DO THIS:
The app is in "Simulation Mode". Emails will NOT differ to your inbox.
Instead, you will see a popup saying "(Simulation)" and the email content will be logged in your VS Code Terminal.
